We will discuss how the HTTP/2 protocol works from the binary framing protocol up, and look at some of the practical differences it makes to real-world applications.\n\n------update-----\n\nSome of you may have heard of the draft HTTP/3 spec, and maybe seen this blog post -> https://daniel.haxx.se/blog/2018/11/11/http-3/\n\nSo the semantics of HTTP/2 don’t change, but the underlying framing basically goes over UDP. We will talk about HTTP/3 a bit and some of the reasons it is being proposed the way it is.",

Increasingly, Postgres is the database of choice for many developers and engineers, and its steadily expanding feature set makes it incredibly competitive among modern data-stores. The aim of the evening will be to highlight some of the less familiar but extremely useful features postgres has to offer, and how these can work with Rails and ActiveRecord.\n\nThe evening will be in two parts. Firstly we've got a line up of speakers, who'll each briefly explain and demo a feature or two. Secondly, we'll have some hands-on challenges and exercises to do. Topics may include:\n\n• Document storage with JSON and jsonb\n\n• Querying schedules with OVERLAPS\n\n• The duration type\n\n• UUIDs, as primary keys and otherwise\n\n• DB contraints, for actual validations and integrity\n\n• Fast full-text search\n\n• Locking\n\n• Subqueries\n\n• Whatever else…\n\nIf you really want to hear about one of the topics above, or something similar, let us know! We're still lining up speakers and topics.\n\nAs always, doors open at 7pm and the talks begin at 7.30pm. See you there!",

So, they designed a small cheap computer and started mass-producing it. They called it the Raspberry pi (https://www.raspberrypi.org/).\n\nFor this months meetup we'll be having talk(s) on the raspberry pi and also a hacknight with the sonic pi (http://sonic-pi.net/) project. Details are somewhat fluid at the moment, but aiming for some sort of collaborative coding / jam session! We are very open to talks if you happen to use a raspberry pi / arduino / any sort of Internet-Of-Things (IoT) talk.\n\nSo, if you like music, you want to know a little more about the Internet of Things and the Raspberry Pi, then come along to this months meetup, we'll also show you how easy it is to make a simple timelapses like this one.\n\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yH4CL9Ox08E\n\nIf you can, please install the sonic pi (http://sonic-pi.net/) project on your laptop before coming along.\n\nSee you there :) - 7:00 for a 7:30 sharp start.",

Here's a map provided by Pomeroy's:\n\nhttp://pomspub.co.nz/contact-location\n\nDoors will open at 7PM, with talks starting at (not before) 7:30PM.\n\nAfter a quick poll in our Slack room (see http://slack.ruby.nz/ for an invitation if you're not already in our Slack) we'll be having talks with the main focus around tooling. We are looking for people to give talks so if you're interested then please let us know (or just reply here).\n\nWe have room for up to 6 lightning talks (5 to 10 min limit), or a mix of lightning + longer talks (up to 20 min). Bear in mind that the more longer talks we have, the fewer available slots there will be for lightning talks so get in fast!\n\nHere are some suggested topics:\n\npry, (pry-remote), ngrok, xray-rails, rack-mini-profiler, docker, git etc.\n\nFor anyone interested, there is usually an ad-hoc meetup for dinner at Pomeroy's downstairs, from around 6PM. There's usually a happy hour on selected drinks ending at 6PM so plan accordingly!\n\nIf anyone is particularly keen to attend this dinner, please let us know by replying and we'll try to make a reservation because it can get busy.\n\nWe hope to see you there!",

It's a set of ruby scripts designed to build vagrant environments for a sensor network project he's been working on called BigSense (http://bigsense.io (http://bigsense.io/)). His story…\n\nIn 2011, Sumit Khanna was an out of work software engineer living in Cincinnati, Ohio. At a friend's birthday party, he met Andrew Rettig, a Geographer who was researching sensor networks. Together they re-purposed off-the-shelf home routers with OpenWRT, an embedded Linux distribution. Several publications later, they released BigSense, a web service that stores and aggregates sensor data. It works with LtSense, a application designed to be run on embedded systems.\n\nIn this talk, Sumit will be talking about vSense, a set of ruby scripts used to build a Vagrant-based virtual environemnt used to quickly provision BigSense/LtSense services as well as test packages on various Linux distributions. vSense is intended to be used by researchers and developers, but is also used in the BigSense production environments hosted at the University of Cincinnati.",

If you don't know what refactoring is, one definition is :\n\n\"Code refactoring is the process of restructuring existing computer code – changing the factoring – without changing its external behavior.\"\n\nIf you've been a programmer for any length of time and have revisited your code, changes are you've refactored without necessarily putting a name against it. In this meetup we are going to demo as many small, or large, refactorings as we can. It can be as simple as extracting methods (or constants), conversion functions, service objects whatever. We would really like to hear from as many people as possible. Please reply on the Google Group https://groups.google.com/forum/#!forum/christchurch-ruby (https://groups.google.com/forum/#%21forum/christchurch-ruby) with what refactoring(s) you are happy to talk about, as we don't want duplicates.\n\nI cannot stress how useful a skill refactoring is to a developer. As soon as you hit legacy code (old code, generally without tests) being able to iteratively improve the codebase is crucial to not tearing all of your hair out. So come along, learn something new, or share the skills you have - it really will make your professional life more fun!\n\nSee you on Thursday 19th March at 7pm (talks will start sharp at 7:30).

He'll be giving a talk on Succeeding with Open Source which — based on his rubygems.org profile (https://rubygems.org/profiles/parndt) — he seems reasonably qualified to give. With 7.5 million downloads of the 54(!) gems he has (co)authored, he's the openest, sourciest person I've had the pleasure to meet.\n\nAs is often the case, we'll have time at the end for a few 5-10 min lightning talks. I'll probably share some vaguely relevant thoughts, and I seem to recall there were some volunteers after our Christmas social too (although that might've been the fine Pomeroys ales talking). So… it'd be great to have a few others to give us a tl;dr on a topic of interest.\n\n7pm, next Thursday (15th Jan), Catalyst office\n\nAny questions, sing out. See you then!\n\nDaniel",

              "description": "Hi All,\n\nThis months meetup will be on Thursday 15th May at the regular venue of Catalysts offices above Pomeroys Pub. There will be two parts to the evening.\n\nFirstly: Talks\n\nWhile not strictly Ruby (well, ok, at all) Nick Butcher is going to give a quick introduction to meteor.js - an up and coming web framework that allows for some pretty incredible apps to be built extremely rapidly. Meteor, while not Ruby is definitely worth a look to see what else is out there, even if DHH thinks Turbolinks is all you need ;) (/me runs for cover!) .. I'm going to do a lightning talk on a couple of tools I've started using since reading the Pragmatic Thinking and Learning book, and there's definitely space for another short to medium sized talk - please contact me if you're keen to talk.\n\nSecondly: Meetup Structure\n\nDaniel Fone and I have been talking about adding a little more structure to the meetups, probably putting out a schedule of upcoming meetups (e.g. this month it's talks, next month it's live coding etc. etc.). This means we can all have visibility over what's next, and hopefully give everyone time to contribute a talk / an idea for a hack night etc. To that end we have this short 5 question survey monkey form:\n\nhttps://www.surveymonkey.com/s/2DZ5FCJ\n\nThe survey is anonymous and only takes about 1-2 minutes to fill in. We'd really appreciate it if as many people as possible can fill it in before the meetup so that we can then discuss the outcomes of the survey during the second half of the evening. The more involvement and contributions we can get the better it'll be for everyone.\n\nAs always, come discuss the above or anything else on our google group\n\nhttps://groups.google.com/forum/#!topic/christchurch-ruby/lXuRuqzk1FE",

If not - this meetup is the one for you.\n\nThe idea with code golf is to take an algorithm and rewrite it into the shortest amount of code possible. It doesn't make for the most readable code, but it's heaps of fun and you get to find out what ARGV.each will do, or $_ etc. Well, you find out if you want to get a good score ;)\n\nFor Railscamp, Daniel Fone made a golfing server. Everyone cloned the repo, and as you pushed up your answer to the problem, the tests would automatically run and your score was published to the leaderboard. Daniel is going to do a talk showing how it was put together, and then there'll be a 19th hole for everyone to work on (work in groups, singly, whatever works, there'll be experienced people to pair with if you've not used Ruby before).\n\nAnyway, lots of fun, see you there.\n\nMore details on our google group:\n\nhttps://groups.google.com/forum/#!topic/christchurch-ruby/O9WWMiSMPvo",
