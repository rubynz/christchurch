Remote jobs aren't always easy to get. Remote jobs working for a Silicon Valley startup when you're applying directly from NZ definitely aren't easy to get, *but*, it is *possible*.

This month we are lucky to have Brendon Muschamp speaking to us about how to go about getting a remote job for a silicon valley startup and some of the challenges and opportunities he has had since doing this. Brendon has been working for Loom a Silicon Valley startup for the last few years. Now, while we can't say he was single-handedly responsible for their $900m recent acquisition, we can't say he wasn't either ;)

Anyway, if you want to hear about some of the opportunities and challenges he faced, and perhaps how you might go about getting one of these roles, come along to this months meetup - it's sure to be an interesting one.
