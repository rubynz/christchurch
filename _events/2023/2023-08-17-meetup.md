location: Saltworks, 4 Ash Street, Christchurch
time: 6:30pm
title: Coding escape, bring a laptop and prepare for a challenge

---

Note: pizza before meetup (please read message!) and the *earlier start time* of 18:30 if you're coming for food (the meetup itself will start at 19:30)

This month we have Ben Tillman giving us a coding challenge. So, bring a laptop if you have one (if you don't - come anyway as working in a group with others is always more fun anyway!).

It won't matter if you're not a ruby programmer - you can use whatever language you like the most, or, if you're inclined, maybe even regex like as happened in previous years!

Ben's company Marmalade [https://www.withmarmalade.com.au/](https://www.withmarmalade.com.au/) has kindly offered to sponsor Pizza before the meetup, so, if you're keen for pizza, please RSVP and join us in the Christchurch channel on slack (go to https://ruby.nz/ and click the link under community and we'll email you a link)

See you there!
