From the things-you-didn't-know-you-could-do-with-a-database department‚Ä¶ This month, Daniel will be sharing his experience building an app with Supabase. Supabase is a "Open Source" company, offering a turnkey platform for building PostgreSQL-backed web APIs (seriously, they are ALL IN on PostgreSQL üòç).

"Supabase is a great place,
For hosting your database.
It's open source and free,
So you can use it with glee.
It's simple to get started,
No infrastructure to be charted.
It's a hosted platform,
So you can use it with no qualm."
