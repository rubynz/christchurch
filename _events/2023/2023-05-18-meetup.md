title: The dominance of the Array in Ruby

At last… a bona fide Ruby talk at the Ruby meet up!

This month, Alexandre Barret will share some insights on the dominance of the array in Ruby — insights gleaned from attempting to safely inherit the Array Ruby core class. He'll cover:

* Quick trivia on Array
* The problem with inheriting Array core class
* How Ruby is specced and tested
* Rubocop and how to create custom cops
* Overview of Grizzly-rb

There will probably be time for lightning talks, so bring your 5 min thought leadership for us all to enjoy!
