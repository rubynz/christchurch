Hey everyone!

This Thursday, 15th June, we have a talk by Steven Chudley with the somewhat provocative title “Embrace the disaster your projects will inevitably become”.

This talk will apparently cover many things, and the title will make more sense once we've experienced it.

There may also be time for lightning talks, so bring your 5 min thought leadership for us all to enjoy.

See you there! 🥳
