title: Asynchronous Rails with Samuel Williams

---

This month we are very fortunate to be graced by the talents, wonderful company, and spoken words of [Samuel Williams](https://ruby.social/@ioquatix) as he presents “Asynchronous Rails”!

I was lucky enough to catch a version of this talk at RubyConf AU in February and I have been told that we are going to be offered an “exclusive” (my words) “more elaborate” (Samuel’s words) version of this.
