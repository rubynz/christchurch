title: Domain Driven Design

This month we are lucky to have Tim Ross giving an introduction to Domain Driven Design.

Domain Driven Design is about designing software based on models of the underlying domain. The model provides a common language to help communication between software developers and domain experts.

This talk will be an introduction to Domain Driven Design and how the concepts can be applied in a Rails application.
