title: you |> introduction to Elixir

---

This month is a two part evening, so, please try to arrive on time at 7:30 (or even 7:10 for setup).

First up, for about 45 minutes or so we'll pair up and work through a fun little coding challenge (it's one of the ones from adventofcode.com , but no, we're not telling you which one ;)

Then, Patrick Davey will work through the same programming puzzle that you'll now be familiar with, but, in the programming language Elixir. Elixir is an amazing language built on top of erlang. Erlang itself has been around since forever, and is the main part of the reason the WhatsApp team was only about 50 people serving 900 million users...

See you there :)
