title: How to make bad decisions

---

One way to learn how to improve is to look at how that thing is done well. Another great way to learn is to look at how that thing is done _badly_ and then not do it that way!

This month we have Luke Arndt giving us a talk on "how to make bad decisions", in the hope that we can avoid making the same mistakes in the future.

As ever, there will be time for lightning talks... so, if you can, do bring something funky that you've learned / seen / used to share with the group.
