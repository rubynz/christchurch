title: Asynchronous Ruby

---

"The goal for Ruby 3 is to improve performance significantly. A number of areas are being explored, including compilation, concurrency, garbage collection, data structures, etc. Server applications processing many concurrent requests are an area where Ruby typically struggles. The typical thread-per-request model is well understood, however threads are a limited resource and can lead to synchronisation issues, deadlocks and other problems. We will discuss the reactor pattern, explore several real world implementations for Ruby, and look at how they compare to existing thread-per-request servers."

Many thanks to Samuel Williams for offering this talk! Does this mean there's no point in learning Elixir ;) ?
