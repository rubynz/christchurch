title: A Vue to a kill & A Technical Explanation of Bitcoin

---

This meetup Patrick Davey will be giving an introduction to the Vue framework and why he chose to use it and an attempt at explaining how it differs from React.

Patrick: "The title is misleading, this talk has nothing to do with James Bond I'm afraid. I'll be giving a general introduction to the Vue framework, why I like it, and maybe building out a duplicate of Sarah's React app for comparing and contrasting."

Also, we will have Pete Nicholls giving us a technical introduction to Bitcoin. " I want to leave you with the impression you could go away and implement your own blockchain". Note, this is _not_ a talk on how to get rich buying Bitcoin ;)
