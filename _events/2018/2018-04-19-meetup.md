title: 'No REST for the Wicked: An Introduction to GraphQL'

---

This month we have Rob Ingram giving us an introduction to GraphQL:

"In 2015 Facebook made public its new data query language GraphQL. We will describe what GraphQL is, how it can be useful in API based applications and compare it to the REST interfaces with which we may be more familiar. We will then walk through an implementation of a GraphQL API for a simple Rails app."
