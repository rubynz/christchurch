title: Down the rabbit hole with HTTP/2

---

This month we're lucky to have Samuel Williams giving us a talk on HTTP/2 ->

HTTP/2, while semantically similar to HTTP/1, is a binary protocol which significantly reduces per-request latency and overhead. Web applications built around the performance characteristics of HTTP/1 no longer perform optimally when served via HTTP/2. This is a problem because estimates suggest that more than 80% of users have web browsers which utilise of HTTP/2 when available. We will discuss how the HTTP/2 protocol works from the binary framing protocol up, and look at some of the practical differences it makes to real-world applications.

------update-----

Some of you may have heard of the draft HTTP/3 spec, and maybe seen this blog post -> https://daniel.haxx.se/blog/2018/11/11/http-3/

So the semantics of HTTP/2 donâ€™t change, but the underlying framing basically goes over UDP. We will talk about HTTP/3 a bit and some of the reasons it is being proposed the way it is.
