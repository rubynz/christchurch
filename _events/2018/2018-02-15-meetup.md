title: A Definitive Guide to Naming Things

---

There’s an old saying that goes, “The two hardest problems in programming are cache invalidation, naming things and off by one errors” In this talk we’ll look at the subtle art of naming things, with a treatment on the common issues that arise when trying to name something, and how to resolve them.

As ever, please come along for 7pm for a 7:30 start, and bring along something to share (anything!) for lightning talks (tools, git / bash / recipe, funky chess move, whatever).

See you on the 15th (it's an early third Thursday!).
