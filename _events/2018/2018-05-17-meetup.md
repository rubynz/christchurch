There exists a set of names for features of code that can indicate deeper problems in your application. These are called "Code Smells". In this talk, Sarah Hay will introduce some of these code smells, and the associated refactorings to take your code from smelly to not-so-smelly.

This talk will be of use to any programmer who has to work with code ;) While the examples will be in ruby, the patterns and techniques will be of use to all.

See you there, and, do have a think of your own favourite refactorings / smells to share :)
