title: Can f.lux stop you getting the blues?

---

This month we're lucky to have Malcolm Locke giving a talk:

"It's the question on pretty much nobody's lips, does f.lux actually work? This talk will be a journey of enlightenment taking us from the flat earth of blind faith to circumnavigate a sphere of topics including physics, physiology, optics and digital imaging to finally maybe answer the question you never even wanted to know the answer to.

The only topic guaranteed to be safe from coverage will be the Ruby programming language."
