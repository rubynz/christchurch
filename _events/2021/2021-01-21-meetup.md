We're going to ease our way into 2021 with an evening of lightning talks for this month. Have a think about something to share, maybe you've played around with ruby 3, maybe you solved a particularly weird bug (maybe you didn't solve it, that happens too ;), or anything else of interest..

We're accepting talks for 2021, please join #christchurch on https://slack.ruby.nz/ to join the discussion.

Here's looking forward to a less locked-down 2021!
