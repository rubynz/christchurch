title: Making Self-Supervised Learning + Startup Equity work for you

---

This month we are lucky to have Nick Butcher back to give us another talk - this time on supervised learning and also how equity works in startups... should be fascinating!

-----EDIT---
There will probably be time for Lightning Talks for the second half, so, bring along something to share if you have anything. Could be a neat library you've come across, some pattern you've been playing with, a book you've read - anything ;)

------------- TALK DETAILS---------

Do you want to have to teach your nascent artificial general intelligence all the facts of the universe using carefully curated hand labelled examples?

Me neither.

Find out how self supervised learning can deliver you from a life of thankless grind, and let you create the seeds of our destruction... or a better image recognition model.

Do you want to create a transformational, world improving, preposterously valuable startup through the wise application of self supervised learning techniques only to end up disenfranchised and poor?

Me neither.

Find out about how different forms of equity in startups work, and what you might want to consider, from someone who is neither a lawyer nor an accountant and whose musings definitely do not constitute financial or legal advice but might give you some ideas to run by an actual qualified person if it ever comes up.
