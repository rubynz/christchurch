title: From dev to prod

---

It's all well and good having lovely shiny sparkly code sitting on your dev machine, but, at some point it needs to wend its merry way to prod. This month we have Wayne here to talk to us about some of his learnings on taking many codebases from dev to prod. The talk will discuss Continuous Integration & Continuous Deployment, as well as other factors you need to consider.

For the second half of the evening there will be time for lightning talks, so keep an eye out for anything interesting you've learned over the last month that you think would be good to share. Can be anything at all, tech related or not, and can just be a minute :) There's always more to learn & share.
