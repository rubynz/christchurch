The meetup is still going ahead, but, unfortunately our overseas special guest speaker Nahum has had to cancel his flights because of the timing of the pesky covid outbreak.

So, bring your best lightning talk. If you happen to be extra prepared and have an actual talk you want to give, please let us know in #christchurch on https://slack.ruby.nz

See you there,
