location: Trineo Ltd, 181 High Street, Christchurch
time: 7:00pm
title: GraphQL2 (yes, we've taken it to the next level)

---

After a couple of introductory talks in the past we’re lucky to have Rob Ingram taking a further look at GraphQL. We’ll cover how to prevent some common problems, best practices for building an API that can evolve over time and how to make the most of features of GraphQL that set it apart from standard REST APIs.

As ever, this meetup will only proceed if we're still at covid Level 1.

Please join us on https://slack.ruby.nz #christchurch for all ruby related ChCh banter.
