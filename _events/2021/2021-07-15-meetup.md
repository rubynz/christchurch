title: Faster pagination in Postgres

---

Is your slow database getting you down? Do other sites load lightning fast and leave you with multi-second database round-trips? What you need is to come to this months meetup where we're lucky to have Mark Haylock from Trineo sharing some of his recent learning about Postgres. Specifically he'll be sharing the results of some experiments in faster pagination, and why it is generally so slow.

Be there, or be stuck with slow queries.
