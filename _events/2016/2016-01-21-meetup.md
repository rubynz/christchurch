The New Year period and January have flown by and our next meetup is this Thursday â€” yes, today.

Come along to Pomeroy's (the beer garden outside, if the weather is nice, which it is currently) for 7pm on Thursday 21st.

No talks this month, just good chats and a chance to catch up on Ruby and the rest.
