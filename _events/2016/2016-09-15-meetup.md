title: Postgres (+ Rails) for Fun and Profit

---

This month we're having a Postgres extravaganza (or PostgreSQL, pgsql, pg, depending on which side of the argument you're on (https://www.postgresql.org/message-id/473D7617.6070900@postgresql.org)). Increasingly, Postgres is the database of choice for many developers and engineers, and its steadily expanding feature set makes it incredibly competitive among modern data-stores. The aim of the evening will be to highlight some of the less familiar but extremely useful features postgres has to offer, and how these can work with Rails and ActiveRecord.

The evening will be in two parts. Firstly we've got a line up of speakers, who'll each briefly explain and demo a feature or two. Secondly, we'll have some hands-on challenges and exercises to do. Topics may include:

• Document storage with JSON and jsonb

• Querying schedules with OVERLAPS

• The duration type

• UUIDs, as primary keys and otherwise

• DB contraints, for actual validations and integrity

• Fast full-text search

• Locking

• Subqueries

• Whatever else…

If you really want to hear about one of the topics above, or something similar, let us know! We're still lining up speakers and topics.

As always, doors open at 7pm and the talks begin at 7.30pm. See you there!
