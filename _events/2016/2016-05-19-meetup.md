Hello everyone! This month we've spent our time helping to organise Rails Girls Christchurch. You have signed up to be a coach, haven't you? If not, the form is here: https://docs.google.com/forms/d/1wQJ93nMrq5nnZ3IWFI61aCMIU_ZiFix4a9a1-A4-gTo/viewform

Due to this, we haven't put much time into planning anything for this month's meet up (sorry! Would anyone else like to help us with the organisational workload?).

So: we would like to propose a less formal rails camp style meet up where everyone gets together and presents on whatever they have available or whatever they feel like on the night. This usually works out really well as everyone has something valuable to talk about, regardless of whether you think you do or not.

Bonus points if someone can create a https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Powerpoint-Karaoke slide deck or two, and if someone else wants to do it.

Otherwise, the social aspect may appeal to you! Either way, hope to see you there on Thursday ðŸ˜€
