title: Working With Legacy Code and Other Bedtime Stories

---

This month we're having a series of talks, led by Mark Haylock and Tim Ross. They'll be speaking on Working With Legacy Code, with a focus on coping with existing legacy code, as well as how to leave a better legacy behind.

In addition, we'll have Pete Nicholls sharing some insights on Sockets in Ruby (the good old-fashioned kind, not the new-fangled websocket/cable thing). Kale Worsley will be sharing some ideas (horrible (https://github.com/horribleideas) or not remains to be seen). Daniel Fone will be talking about Monkey Patching for Fun and Profit.

Will there be others — maybe! Will it be you — why not?! Let me know if you've got a brief talk, we'd love to hear from you.

As usual, doors open 7pm, talks kick off at 7:30pm.
