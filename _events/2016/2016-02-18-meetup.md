Wow, only 3 days until this month's meetup!

Coming off the back of this year's RubyConf Australia, we'll have a run down of some of the talks there â€” along with space for lightning talks on any subject! Let us know if you've got a 5 min topic you'd like to speak on.

Following this, we'll be trying our hand at Katrina Owen's excellent exercism.io, a fun, challenging, and frankly therapeutic look at (re)factoring code.

See you there! Doors open 7pm, talks kick off at 7:30pm.
