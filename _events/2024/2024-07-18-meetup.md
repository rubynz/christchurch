title: Get Gud (at Git)

---

This month we have Ashton Moore giving us the low-down on one of the most commonly used tools in a developer's tool-kit. He writes:

"Git is a tool we all know (and possibly love), but let’s be honest - it has a tendency to fade into the background in our day-to-day work. In this talk, I’d like to put a spotlight on git, show that there’s more to it than just add/commit/push, and motivate *why* you should get gud at git. I may even share some ways of doing so."

See you there!
