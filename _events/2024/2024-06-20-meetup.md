title: Practical Cryptography for Developers

---

This month we have Pete Nicholls here to give us an intro to what we, as developers should know about cryptography. Personally, all I know is that I should never ever write my own.. so, I'm looking forward to learning heaps!

In Pete's words -> "As developers, we encounter cryptography all the time: SSH keys, SSL/TLS certificates, password hashing, JWT signing, and so on. There are plenty of tutorials and libraries to help us. But what does “AES-256-CTR-HMAC” *mean* anyway? Why does the world of cryptography have to be so… cryptic? In this talk, I’d like to share some practical lessons I’ve learned working with cryptography over the years."

See you there!
