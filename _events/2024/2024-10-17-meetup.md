This month Rob Ingram is giving us a run-down of all things version 8:

> The number eight is prominent in the Rails world at the moment with the recent(ish) release of Turbo 8 and the impending arrival of Rails 8. We'll take a tour of both, first looking at the changes in Turbo 8 and how it makes it even easier to build modern interactive applications without a custom JavaScript. Then we'll take a look at what to expect in Rails 8 when it is released.

See you there!
