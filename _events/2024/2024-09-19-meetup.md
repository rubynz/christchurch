title: How to Train your Manager
---

Leadership, management, and technical decisions never go hand in hand. This month we are lucky to have Dave Park leading a discussion about how to communicate effectively with your management team to get you what you want. Hopefully by the end of this you'll learn a bit about your own communicate styles and get some tips about both being a SME and manager.

See you there :)
