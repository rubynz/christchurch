title: Turbo Native â€” from Rails app to app store in a week*

---

This month we have Dan Lawler bringing us up to speed on one of the next-generation Rails features. Specifically, going from Rails app to app store in a week.\*

From the hotwired docs:

"Turbo Native for iOS provides the tooling to wrap your Turbo-enabled web app in a native iOS shell. It manages a single WKWebView instance across multiple view controllers, giving you native navigation UI with all the client-side performance benefits of Turbo. Turbo Native for Android provides the same kind of tooling, managing a single WebView instance across multiple Fragment destinations."

*\* your mileage may vary*

See you there!
