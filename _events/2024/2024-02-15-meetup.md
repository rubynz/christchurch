This month, we're delighted to introduce debut speaker Albert Nisbet. He writesâ€¦

"It's object-oriented programming but not as you know it! In this presentation, I'll be reflecting on the role programming has played in my recent foray into 3D printing. Join me to discover a new language for 3D parts, instantiate real-world art, and compile some triangles."

Albert is a Product Software Engineer currently working with the crew at Kilterset. He's previously worked at Hatch and Xero. You can find more Albert at https://albert.nz/
