This month we are lucky to have Dan Lawler talking to us about about a successful launch of a mobile app built using Hotwire - Turbo-Native...

An extension to Rob Ingram's Hotwire ([https://hotwired.dev/](https://hotwired.dev/)) talk, we'll discuss Hotwire's Turbo Native implementation. After a couple years of prep work slowly converting our Rails app to be fully Turbo compliant (a component of Hotwire, see [https://turbo.hotwired.dev/](https://turbo.hotwired.dev/)), with the help of Jumpstart Pro's iOS and Android template projects, we were able to launch two native apps within a week. Come learn how imposter developers can do wonderful things with wonderful Rails-team libraries.

See you there!
