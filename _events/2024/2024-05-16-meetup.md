This month we are lucky to have Saray Hay speaking to us on the subject of Women in Programming. Come along to celebrate the women who have pioneered crucial developments in software and information technology. A bit of a history lesson, followed by a discussion of the opportunities we have to combat the challenges facing women in the industry.
