This month we are lucky to have Malcolm Locke to reveal the inner workings of Postgres.

"I'll try to distill the details most relevant to engineers from Egor Rogov's book. This talk should be useful to anyone who uses PostgreSQL as a database for their applications. A basic knowledge of SQL will be assumed."

Who knows what'll be in here, but, Malcolm casually mentioned the other day that he was creating a table with 20000+ (I think) columns just to see how it would fail (because he knew it would from the book!)

Madness.

Anyway, should be a really interesting meetup - see you there.
