Dear [FNAME],

Thank you for choosing Aphelion Adventures Inc for your next stellar cruise.

You will be flying on *The Gemstone of the Skies*, our state-of-the-art AI-crewed stellar cruise liner. Your journey will take in the majestic volcanoes of Io, the lush clouds of Venus, and the iconic rings of Saturn.

Rest assured, after the well-publicised incident on our last tour, the responsible AIs have been retired and a new AI crew has been meticulously trained by our reinstated Safety and Alignment team. **We are certain there will be no incidents on this tour.**

**REMINDER**

To maximize your enjoyment probability, please bring your personal computing device and an emergency locator beacon with a range of at least 778 million km.
