Patrick has been away travelling for a year, and is now back in ChCh. There will be a short talk including, but not limited to, the simplest way to manage your dotfiles (and why you should) and pictures of Orca.

What more could you possibly want in a meetup? But seriously, we do have spaces for technical talks - so if you have something you'd like to demo / discuss, please do get in touch.

Thanks!
