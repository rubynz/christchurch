title: The Joy of (Enterprise) Refactoring

---

Back by popular demand, we are reprising our Joy of Refactoring (https://www.meetup.com/Christchurch-Ruby-Group/events/238205006/) meetup. This time, however, it's Enterprise Ready™.

Once again we'll have a tiny* Rails app, this time featuring a simple Xero integration. For the first half of the night, we'll pair up and explore some of the ways we can reorganise the code to be more readable, reliable, and ultimately more joyful. During the second half, we'll discuss the results, along with the pros and cons of the various techniques that emerge.

If you're looking for inspiration, I highly recommend this talk (https://vimeo.com/91672848?__s=naxcynizt6remua6p7iv) examining the purpose of OO software design.

And always remember…

> Any way you want it to be, that's just right.
