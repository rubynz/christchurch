Bring out your bugs, bring out your bugs (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=grbSQ6O6kbs)

This month Philip Arndt will be kick starting a discussion on bugs (interesting and otherwise). There are so many bugs out there, and learning from these situations is a great way to level up, as by definition, it's something that was unforeseen.

Please bring along a tale of your latest / most interesting bug to share, the more stories the better.
