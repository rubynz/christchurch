Another circumambulation around the sun almost completed, and therefore December's meetup will be our yearly social meetup. Drinks from 7pm at Pomeroys (either upstairs or in the beer garden, depending on sunshine & space available).

Also - games!.. If you have a favourite game/boardgame bring it along and we'll hopefully have time for a few games. Also, you might find out why December (which sounds like it should be the 10th month), isn't.

Thanks to all our wonderful speakers for making this year a real success! We'll be putting out a call for speakers for next year later on, but, if you want to pre-emptively put your hand up for next year, please do ;)

If you haven't already joined us on slack - please do join the https://slack.ruby.nz/ (there's a #christchurch)

Well, see you on the 21st.

Patrick & Daniel & Phil :)
