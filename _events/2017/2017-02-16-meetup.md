Rails Camp is nearly upon us (http://camp.ruby.nz/)! As such, we’ll just be meeting for a drink and a chat this month. If someone has a demo or a talk — all the better!

We’ll either be in the bar, upstairs at Catalyst, or in the beer garden depending on the weather and busyness. Keep an eye on the twitter feed (https://twitter.com/chchruby) from 7pm if you can’t find us.

And I’ll probably bring my deck of exploding kittens…
