Do you know what Microservices are? Do you know when you might use them? Do you know the pitfalls? If not (or even if you do!) this is the meetup for you:

Tim Ross will be giving us an overview of Microservices architecture and some lessons learned from a recent project using Microservices and Rails API.

As per usual there'll be an opportunity for lightning talks, so bring along the latest cool thing you've been playing with and teach us all a thing or two.

See you there :)
