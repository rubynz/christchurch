title: 'Meetup: software development tales in the style of One Thousand and One Nights!'

---

This month we are lucky to have Pete Nicholls regaling us with a "collection of tales from software development history, told in the style of One Thousand and One Nights"

Just how Pete is going to rework tales like Alibaba and the forty thieves is anyone's guess, however, if history is anything to go by, it'll be a entertaining and interesting talk.

There will be time for lightning talks after, so, bring along the latest thing you've learned / experimented with and let us know.

See you on the 15th.
