title: The Joy of Refactoring

---

This month we'll be attempting a calm and peaceful refactoring session in the style of Bob Ross' Joy of Painting (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VlucWfTUo1A).

We'll be working through a few examples of Ruby and Rails code, and practicing some of the ways we can make code more readable and maintainable.

Remember, there are no mistakesâ€¦ just happy little accidents!
