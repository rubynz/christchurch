title: Let's Do An eCommerce!

---

Isaac Freeman of Stembolt will be live-coding an eCommerce site using Solidus, and discussing the various decisions and trade-offs you have to make when you're adding customisations and extensions on top of a large complex platform.

There will, as always, be time for any short lightning talks in the second half of the eve.

See you there!
