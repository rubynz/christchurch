title: 'Being inclusive: ActiveRecord eager loading internals'

---

This month we have Malcolm Locke from Trineo with a talk on Active Record internals: Eager loading is one of the keys tools available for improving performance in the average Rails application. This talk will discuss how eager loading works, and some of it's limitations and pitfalls.

To paraphrase Douglas Adams -> "I love, N+1 queries, I love the whooshing sound they make as they fly by" ;)

As usual, there will be time for lightning talks, so, bring along something interesting to share - or just a question to ask - we'll take the lot!

See you on the 17th.
