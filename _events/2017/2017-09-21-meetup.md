title: Building an app with Webpacker and Rails 5.1

---

This month we have Mark Haylock from Trineo giving a talk on using the webpacker gem with rails 5.1 . This seems to be the future of the asset pipeline in Rails, so, come along and learn how things are changing.

The future is here. Well, it will be on the 21st ;)
