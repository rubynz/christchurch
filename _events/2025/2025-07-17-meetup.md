This month, Alex Barret will be taking Ruby out of it's usual comfort zone:

> Ever thought about using Ruby beyond the web? In this talk, I’ll introduce mruby, a lightweight implementation of Ruby designed for embedding, and show how I’m using it to build a TUI framework that runs as a native binary. If you’ve ever been curious about scripting outside the usual runtime, packaging Ruby as a standalone executable, or building your own developer tools, this is a great place to start.
