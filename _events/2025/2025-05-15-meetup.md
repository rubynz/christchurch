title: Minimal Viable Compliance: Dealing with regulatory requirements when you’d rather be coding
---

Isaac Freeman, who is not a lawyer, will, without offering any legal advice, talk, but in no way make any legally-binding recommendations about, regulatory compliance. What is a “quality management system”? What is “risk management”? Am I a “human resource”? Isaac, a non-lawyer, will run through an approach that keeps things simple, then ask you how your organisation deals with this management stuff. He will not at any point assume that you are a lawyer either.
