title: "Minimal Viable Compliance: Dealing with regulatory requirements when you’d rather be coding"
---

Isaac Freeman, _who is not a lawyer_, will, _without offering any legal advice_, talk, _but in no way make any legally-binding recommendations about_, regulatory compliance. What is a “quality management system”? What is “risk management”? Am I a “human resource”? Isaac, _a non-lawyer_, will run through an approach that keeps things simple, then ask you how your organisation deals with this management stuff. _He will not at any point assume that you are a lawyer either._
