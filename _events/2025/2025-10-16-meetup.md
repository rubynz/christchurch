This month we have Pete Nicholls talking about ->

As developers, we are focused on problem-solving. But how do those problems get there in the first place, and how did somebody put a price tag on your work? In this talk, I’ll share some observations from the sales cycle, the business planning cycle, and the industry boom-bust cycles that may help you better understand the environment you work in and how it impacts your roadmap, workload, future opportunities, and happiness at work. 

See you there!
