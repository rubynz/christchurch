title: "An introduction to Elixir"

This month we have Patrick Davey giving an introduction to Elixir.

"In this talk I'm going to give a really high-level introduction to the Elixir language, the VM (The BEAM) Elixir code runs on, common patterns and pitfalls, and depending on time there'll be a brief introduction to Phoenix (the Rails of Elixir)".
