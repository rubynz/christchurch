title: "Building a Scalable and Reliable Payment System"
---

This month we have Tim Ross from Riparide talkign about his work with payment engineering:

How do you grow a payment system from its first transaction to millions of dollars, across multiple currencies and countries, without things falling apart? In this talk, I’ll break down the engineering decisions behind Riparide’s payment system, share what worked (and what didn’t) when building on Stripe, and discuss the techniques we use to keep transactions reliable, prevent double charges, and ensure every cent is accounted for.
