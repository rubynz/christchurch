title: The One-Person Infrastructure

This talk is totally dear to my heart, as this month we have **Dave Harris** giving us a walk on the one-person infrastructure. I think it's super cool to be able to take your own work into prod and run it all yourself - so come along and learn the right way to do it!

---------------------

AWS Elastic Beanstalk lets you deploy and scale a Rails app with minimal fuss â€” usually you barely have to think about infrastructure at all. But what happens when you do need to touch the servers? Join me on a journey from the wild west of open-port SSH to a modern, security-conscious workflow using AWS Session Manager, short-lived keys, 2FA, Touch ID and 1Password integration. Whether you love have pets or cattle, there'll be something for everyone.
