title: Exploring dry-rb with a Rails application
---

You may have heard of dry-rb, a so-called "collection of next-generation Ruby libraries", but thought that it's mostly for alternative frameworks like Hanami and shouldn't bother with it when using Rails. Join Phil on this interactive exploration as he walks through how we might build a feature inside a Rails application using some of the libraries in the collection. We can discuss the pros and cons of various approaches as we go.
