title: The Human’s Guide to the LLM
---

"Welcome, humans, to a brave new world—one where AI models like ChatGPT and its friends roam free, tackling problems and solving puzzles at an alarming rate. But fear not! Ben Tillman is here to be your guide.

In this interactive session, Ben will explore the fascinating parallels and stark differences between human and AI approaches to problem-solving. How do large language models (LLMs) think? Do they even "think" at all? More importantly, how can we humans collaborate, coexist, or even compete with our artificial counterparts?

Join us for an evening where we'll pit human intuition against artificial intelligence in live, interactive problem-solving scenarios. Expect hands-on challenges, lively debate, and perhaps even a few existential questions."

Does this playful description hit the mark? Let me know if you'd like to tweak any aspects!
