title: ⚡️ Lightning Talks

---

As we kick off the new year, we'll open up the mic for Lightning Talks for our January meetup. Come along with a 5-20 min rant about:
* the best way to organise your fridge,
* how AGI is going to turn the universe into paperclips,
* why "off-by-one errors" are equally devastating in code and knitting scarves,
* haiku as a proto-vectorisation of seasonal semantics,
* 34 changes in Ruby 3.4.

(No other topics will be accepted. Sorry)

See you there!
