title: The not-ruby ruby meetup

---

Hi all,

This month it's our "not ruby (!ruby)" Ruby meetup. For this one bring along a lightning talk on anything which isn't to do with ruby. Can be technical, but, it certainly doesn't have to be.

Also, we'll be putting out our yearly call for presenters shortly. If you're keen, either message us here, or (better) jump into #christchurch on http://slack.ruby.nz/

See you on the 16th - Happy New Year :)
