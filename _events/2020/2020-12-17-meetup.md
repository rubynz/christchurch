Aaaaaaaaallll righty then. 2020 almost behind us, multiple covid vaccines on the horizon, and generally things are beginning to look up. It's definitely time to celebrate & unwind at the annual December social.

So - bring along some end-of-year cheer, musical instruments and games (board games, card games, entire pool tables (assuming you can carry them)) and see you for a fun evenings entertainment :)
