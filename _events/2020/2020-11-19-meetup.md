title: 'Sarah Learns Network Programming Part 1: Introduction to Sockets'

---

For the final talk of the year we're lucky to have Sarah from Trineo giving an introduction to sockets. She's going to attempt to answer questions like: What are they? Where did they come from? How does one use them?

So come along to learn about one of the fundamental building blocks on top of which our entire ~~house of cards~~ industry, is built on ;)

See you there
