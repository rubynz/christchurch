Donald Rumsfeld had the memorable quote :

"There are known knowns; there are things we know we know. We also know there are known unknowns; that is to say we know there are some things we do not know."

In this talk Steve is going to put another twist on this idea: "There are things your users know that they don't know they know, but that they wish you knew"

PLEASE NOTE THE CHANGE IN LOCATION. We are now at Trineo's offices - Level 1, 181 High Street. This will be the location for the ruby meetup going forward, and many thanks to Trineo for the use of the space.
