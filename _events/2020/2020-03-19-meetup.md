title: What next? Reflections on 15 years, 24 apps, and 1 mistake.

---

This month I want to start a conversation I've been planning for a very long time. I want to briefly reflect on my experience writing a lot of web applications, and then describe my now quite detailed vision for how I want to develop web apps in the future. This will feature Declarative Delightfulness, Helpful Hypermedia, Prized Postgresql, Joyful JSON schemas, Adaptable API specs, Steadfast SQL, and much more. This will not feature graphql.

I've been thinking about this for 2 years and 5 months, so I hope the heckling will be robust. As always, doors open 7pm and talk kicks off at 7.30pm.

See you there!

Daniel
