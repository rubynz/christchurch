WWWWOOOOOHOOOOO! Level 1 here we come. This month it's going to be an**actual in-person meetup**. Our hosts Trineo require that anyone attending the meetup scan in at the door with the NZ Covid Tracer app.

This month we are will have an intro to localstack given by Mark Haylock, and after that we'll be opening it up for lightning talks. Please have a think of something to share (ruby related or otherwise, we're not picky!).

See you there (assuming we stay at level 1, otherwise the meetup will be cancelled)
