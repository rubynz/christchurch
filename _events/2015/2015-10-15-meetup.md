Did you know that they played Os and Xs in the days of the Roman Empire?!

This month we have a small programming challenge based on the game of Naughts and Crosses (or Tic-Tac-Toe or Terni Lapilli or whatever you want to call it). Though a truly delightful amount of math and computer science can be brought to bear on the humble 3x3 grid, this will be a straightforward challenge for Rubyists of any experience (from what's-a-gem (https://rubygems.org/) to i-can't-believe-those-incremental-GC-gains (https://engineering.heroku.com/blogs/2015-02-04-incremental-gc/)). Bring your laptop if you can, or be prepared to partner with someone who's got one.

As usual, the doors will be open from 7pm for drinks and a chat, and we'll be kicking things off at 7:30pm.

See you there!
