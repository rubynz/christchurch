title: What do you get if you cross Ruby and Beer? & more talks

---

This month we are having talks, including but not limited to one from Pete Nicholls on his beer setup. More details to come, but it involves at least Rack and Ruby and Beer. I mean really, what more does a talk need?

There are spots for more talks, lightning or otherwise - please contact here or on the Christchurch-Ruby mailing list (https://groups.google.com/group/christchurch-ruby)

This is also going to be my last ChCh Ruby meetup for at least a year as I'm off travelling. So come say hello & think about putting your hand up to help run the group along with Daniel Fone and Philip Arndt. Your ruby group needs you!

Okay, that's it - see you on the 19th.

Patrick
