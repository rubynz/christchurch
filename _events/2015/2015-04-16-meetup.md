title: Scripting Vagrant with Sumit Khanna

---

This month we have a guest speaker. Sumit Khanna works on an open source project called vSense (https://github.com/BigSense/vSense). It's a set of ruby scripts designed to build vagrant environments for a sensor network project he's been working on called BigSense (http://bigsense.io (http://bigsense.io/)). His storyâ€¦

In 2011, Sumit Khanna was an out of work software engineer living in Cincinnati, Ohio. At a friend's birthday party, he met Andrew Rettig, a Geographer who was researching sensor networks. Together they re-purposed off-the-shelf home routers with OpenWRT, an embedded Linux distribution. Several publications later, they released BigSense, a web service that stores and aggregates sensor data. It works with LtSense, a application designed to be run on embedded systems.

In this talk, Sumit will be talking about vSense, a set of ruby scripts used to build a Vagrant-based virtual environemnt used to quickly provision BigSense/LtSense services as well as test packages on various Linux distributions. vSense is intended to be used by researchers and developers, but is also used in the BigSense production environments hosted at the University of Cincinnati.
