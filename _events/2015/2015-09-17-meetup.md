title: Raspberry Pi, SonicPi, Internet-Of-Thingsish

---

A few years ago some academics in Cambridge were wondering why there was such a decline in computer science students. One of the things they identified was that people weren't growing up tinkering with computers. Not in the game-playing sense, but more in the programming sense. So, they designed a small cheap computer and started mass-producing it. They called it the Raspberry pi (https://www.raspberrypi.org/).

For this months meetup we'll be having talk(s) on the raspberry pi and also a hacknight with the sonic pi (http://sonic-pi.net/) project. Details are somewhat fluid at the moment, but aiming for some sort of collaborative coding / jam session! We are very open to talks if you happen to use a raspberry pi / arduino / any sort of Internet-Of-Things (IoT) talk.

So, if you like music, you want to know a little more about the Internet of Things and the Raspberry Pi, then come along to this months meetup, we'll also show you how easy it is to make a simple timelapses like this one.

If you can, please install the sonic pi (http://sonic-pi.net/) project on your laptop before coming along.

See you there :) - 7:00 for a 7:30 sharp start.
