This month's exciting meetup is at Thursday, 20th August and will be back at our usual location of the Catalyst office above Pomeroy's (Level 1, 284 Kilmore Street). Here's a map provided by Pomeroy's:

Doors will open at 7PM, with talks starting at (not before) 7:30PM.

After a quick poll in our Slack room (see http://slack.ruby.nz/ for an invitation if you're not already in our Slack) we'll be having talks with the main focus around tooling. We are looking for people to give talks so if you're interested then please let us know (or just reply here).

We have room for up to 6 lightning talks (5 to 10 min limit), or a mix of lightning + longer talks (up to 20 min). Bear in mind that the more longer talks we have, the fewer available slots there will be for lightning talks so get in fast!

Here are some suggested topics:

pry, (pry-remote), ngrok, xray-rails, rack-mini-profiler, docker, git etc.

For anyone interested, there is usually an ad-hoc meetup for dinner at Pomeroy's downstairs, from around 6PM. There's usually a happy hour on selected drinks ending at 6PM so plan accordingly!

If anyone is particularly keen to attend this dinner, please let us know by replying and we'll try to make a reservation because it can get busy.

We hope to see you there!
