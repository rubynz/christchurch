Hi all!

December has flown by and our next meetup is this Thursday â€” yes, in just 2 days.

Come along to Pomeroys (the beer garden outside, if the weather is nice) for 7pm on Thursday 17th. No talks this month, just good chats and a chance to catch up on Ruby and the rest.

If past years are anything to go by, there's likely to be werewolf (or maybe even some Exploding Kittens!) afterwards, so bring your best game face.

There'll probably be a contingent getting dinner beforehand, so if you're interested in that let me know either here or on the mailing list.

Anyway, see you at Pomeroys on the 17th :)
