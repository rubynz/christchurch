time: 7:00pm
title: Not Ruby Ruby meetup ;)

---

This meetup we are having lighting talks on *Non Ruby* topics. Ideally non technical talks, but we'll take anything as long as it's not Ruby (or programming specific)

Talks can be anywhere between 5 and 15 mins, and should just be about something you're interested in! So, we should all learn something and certainly it'll be different.

As per usual, 7pm doors open for a 7:30 kick off.

So, come one come all, it's time for something completely different
