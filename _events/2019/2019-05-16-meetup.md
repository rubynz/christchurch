title: 'Unspoilt By Progress: An Introduction to Progressive Web Apps'

---

This month's talk will be from Rails freelancer and meetup regular Rob Ingram.

> Progressive Web Apps (PWAs) provide a new paradigm for how we use and develop web based applications. We'll look at what we mean by Progressive Web Apps and delve into their features and the technologies that enable them before looking into the code of a small example PWA.

Apparently "there will definitely be time for lightning talks", so come prepared to share your latest TMIL (This Month I Learnt)

As always, doors open at 7pm, talks kick off at 7.30pm.
