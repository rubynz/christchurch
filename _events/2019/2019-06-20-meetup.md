title: 'Sarah Learns the Ruby Standard Library Part I: FileUtils and CSV'

---

From our very own Sarah Hay (the only singer/songwriter/engineer I've heard sing about refactoring!)

"By popular demand, Iâ€™m going to give a talk on a couple of modules in the Ruby Standard Library with which people may not be too familiar: CSV and FileUtils.
From the basic to the brilliant, come along, bring your friends and see me live demo some of the really useful features these staples of the Ruby Standard Library provide. Bring questions!"

As always, doors open at 7pm, talks kick off at 7.30pm.
