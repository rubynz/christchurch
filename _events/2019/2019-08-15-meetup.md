title: PREPARE TO REPEL BOARDERS with Rails 5.2 Attributes API

---

This month we have Patrick Davey giving an introduction to form objects. He'll show how they work, when and where you'd use & overuse them, and how the fantastic Rails 5.2 Attributes API fits into it.

There will be time for lightning talks afterwards, so, have a think of anything cool you've played with in the last month, and come prepared to show & tell.

See you at the meetup.
