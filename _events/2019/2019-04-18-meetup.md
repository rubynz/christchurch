title: 'A Tale of Two CTEs: A Postgresql Adventure'

---

This will be a jaunty frolic through two SQL queries, diving deeply into the single most useful and reliable component in our modern software stack. On the way, we will sample a smorgasboard of postgresql tricks I found useful to do a thing I was trying to do.

* JSON querying
* Lateral joins
* date_trunc
* percentile_disc
* distinct on
* Non-recursive Common Table Expressions (CTEs), which are very different fromâ€¦
* Recursive CTEs
* Loose index scans and
* A very simple look at how the query planner plans its queries

Of course, we can also talk about event sourcing since that's what everyone else is talking about too.
