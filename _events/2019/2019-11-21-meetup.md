title: Rewriting  LandOnline for LINZ

---

This month Wayne Carter has very kindly agreed to fly back from the North Island to give a talk on his work rewriting LandOnline for LINZ.

There will probably be time for lightning talks after, so, have a think about what you've been working on or playing with for the last month, and come ready to share :)

See you there :)
