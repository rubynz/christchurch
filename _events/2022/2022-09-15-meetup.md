title: Contributing to PostgreSQL for fun and profit*

---

This month, Daniel Fone will be discussing his (mis)adventures fixing a bug in the pgcrypto extension, understanding the pgsql-hackers mailing list, and trying to get a patch applied during the commitfest.

\* He failed to contribute, he didn't have fun, and no-one profited.
