OUR VENUE HAS CHANGED - Saltworks 4 Ash street.

Hi all,

We're kicking off the new year with lightning talks at our new venue, kindly hosted by the awesome co-working space called Saltworks https://works.nz/saltworks/ . It's at 4 Ash street.

The doors will be closed, but, we'll have someone there from 7pm, and a number you can call if you get stuck outside. Either that or jump into #christchurch on https://slack.ruby.nz and ask for help.

Please bring a lightning talk to share and lets get this meetup re-started! ;)

Many many thanks to Leon and the Saltworks crew for allowing us to host using their space.

You must have a vaccine pass to attend.
