title: Lightning Talks (short talks on a bunch of subjects)

---

This month we have lightning talks. The floor is open for anyone to give a brief (5 - 10 mins) talk about anything you think may be of interest to the group. Quantity is preferable over quality (although both is ideal), we'd rather have a whole heap of loose show and tell style presentations than a few well prepared ones. So now is the time for all you lurkers to raise your hands!

If you'd like to present please comment here and / or send a pull request with your talk details to https://github.com/nzruby/talks

If you wish to use slides or give a live demo, please ensure you can present either VGA or a standard HDMI socket to the projector.
