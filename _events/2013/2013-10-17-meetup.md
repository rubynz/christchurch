title: Newbies Night - come for an introduction to Ruby on Rails

---

We'll be having a set of short talks on various subjects, followed by an 'Installfest' where members of the group will be available to help you install Ruby / Rails on your machines.

The focus will be on beginner programmers, and those with experience in other languages who are interested in learning more about Ruby.

Now for the audience participation part!

• If there is a particular subject you are interested in hearing more about, please let us know. We'll try and ensure any requested topics are covered as a priority.

• If you're willing to give a short talk (around 10 minutes) on the night, please let us know.

We already have a couple of speakers lined up, but need more, don't be shy!
