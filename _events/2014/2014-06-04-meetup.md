Very short notice for this (ad hoc) meetup tonight at 17:30pm

The Wellington ruby group are having a meetup on running your own VPS (your own server in the cloud). They'll be discussing Docker, Chef for provisioning, automated tools like cloud66 I believe and probably a few other things.

We're not quite sure what sort of video link we're going to have - possibly a google hangout - and certainly a DoubleRobot if all else fails. So the video quality may not be perfect, but the content should more than make up for it!

Come down to the Resolve Digital offices anytime from 17:30 (the WellRailed meetup will start at 6pm).
