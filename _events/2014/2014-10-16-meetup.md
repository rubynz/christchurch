Hi,

This months meetup is at 7pm Thursday 16th Oct at Catalysts office above Pomeroys. The meetup is going to be code-golf, but with a twist. The twist is that instead of trying to write the solution in the minimum number of chars, you have to make the code as fast as possible. Daniel came up with the idea after being inspired by Avdi Grimm's challenge on Github ( https://gist.github.com/avdi/1b85c8673d72635cd967 )

Here's how it'll work:

• 20 minute primer on benchmarking and profiling in ruby

• Play code-golf, but with the ~5 holes being slow (in the rough/bunker) and primed for optimisation

Compete for the best improvement / fastest time / highest IPS!

Many thanks to Daniel for making his code-golf server work for the profiling... and in the immortal words of Maverick & Goose : https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fR2hajcuFEM#t=7

See you there,
Patrick
