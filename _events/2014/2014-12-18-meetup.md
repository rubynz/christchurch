Come along to Pomeroys (beer garden outside, if the weather is nice) for 7pm on Thursday 18th. No talks this week, just good chats and a chance to catch up on all things Ruby, and maybe some other topics too, who knows, stranger things have happened.

In January we'll be back to talks (Philip Arndt is back in town) - and then straight on to the RailsCamp for Feb most likley.

Anyway, see you at Pomeroys on the 18th :)
