title: Tanks! Guns!  - Come shoot a fellow rubyist

---

Have you ever wanted to get into a virtual tank and zoom around the place shooting other tanks? If the answer is "Yes", or "Maybe" then this months meetup is for you. You'll get to program a robot and then pit it against your fellow competitors in a battle to destruction.

So write your def crazy_ivan and def bezerker and all the rest. It'll be fun. It'll be real. It'll be really fun.

Anyway, see you there.. screenshot attached to whet your appetite!
