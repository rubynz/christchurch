title: Introduction to Ruby on Rails (CompSoc)

---

At this meetup we will be giving an introduction to the Ruby on Rails web framework. There will be an opportunity to play with the framework and see how cloud services can be used to deploy your app to the Internet. There will also be a very gentle introduction to Test Driven Development.

Please note the earlier start time of 6pm. This is so we can ensure everyone attending has a correct install of Ruby.

Evening Flow:

• Live demonstration of a basic Ruby on Rails install and deploy.

• Students team up with Ruby Developers and make their own app.

• Pizza! There will be pizza sponsored by Resolve Digital, please RSVP to ensure that we have the correct numbers.

Prerequisites : We ask that any student attending comes with a laptop with Ruby installed. For Windows users we suggest installing from http://railsinstaller.org/en . For MAC users we suggests using https://rvm.io/

Help is available if you run into problems installing. Please signup and post questions to either our Google Group at : https://groups.google.com/forum/#!forum/christchurch-ruby , or you can join our IRC channel #nzruby on freenode.

One easy way to login to IRC is to go to https://kiwiirc.com/client , fill in '#nzruby' as the channel, choose a nickname, and join (screenshot attached)

Anyone there should be able to help you with your install issues.

Further Information:

If you want to take things a step further on your own you can learn the basics of the language with http://mislav.uniqpath.com/poignant-guide/ (slightly crazy, but fun)

If you're on windows, you can install ansicon http://softkube.com/blog/ansi-command-line-colors-under-windows (note, install to c:\ansicon .. not anywhere else!)

Ok, that's probably it, please feel free to ask any questions here or on IRC or the google group. We're really looking forward to giving you a good introduction to Rails, maybe you'll build the next AirBnb / Soundcloud / Twitter with it.. :)
