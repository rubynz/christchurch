title: 'Ben Kearns: "Breaking Rails"'

---

Visiting security consultant Ben Kearns will be using a typical Rails app to walk through the general process of hacking web applications and finding and exploiting bugs. He'll then present some tips on how to protect yourself when developing Rails applications.

After the talk he and a colleague will be running a general webapp hacking lab. In terms of materials, a laptop with a working version of Java (preferably official Oracle) is all that should be needed.

Ben is a former Rails developer and now works as a Security Consultant for Lateral Security breaking web applications, networks and anything else he can get his hands on.

NB This event is limited to 20 since there isn't heaps of desk space at Catalyst. If you end up on the wait list, feel free to come along but be aware we might not have room for everyone to work through the lab.
