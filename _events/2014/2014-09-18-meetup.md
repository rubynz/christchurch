Hi all,

For our next meetup on Thursday 18th September (7pm, Pomeroys) we are lucky to have David Jones visiting his home town of ChCh temporarily from San Francisco. David has offered to give a talk on Practical Machine Learning:

A rough outline to whet your appetite:

Get a non-mathematical beginners introduction to machine learning See examples of where ML is being used today Find out how to identify where ML might be useful in your app Find out about selecting “features” for a ML problem Prediction.io (http://prediction.io/): why it’s a good solution for developers and how to use it with Ruby See results of a recent A/B test using prediction.io (http://prediction.io/) on a production application. Questions. After that we will have time for some lightning talks.. so please bring some projects or tools or something fun to share.

See you there!
