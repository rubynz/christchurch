title: Code Golf - Monthly Meeting

---

Hi All,

The next Christchurch Ruby meetup is Thursday 20th March, 7pm, at Catalyst (above Pomeroys).

Have you ever played code golf? Do you know what code golf is? If not - this meetup is the one for you.

The idea with code golf is to take an algorithm and rewrite it into the shortest amount of code possible. It doesn't make for the most readable code, but it's heaps of fun and you get to find out what ARGV.each will do, or $_ etc. Well, you find out if you want to get a good score ;)

For Railscamp, Daniel Fone made a golfing server. Everyone cloned the repo, and as you pushed up your answer to the problem, the tests would automatically run and your score was published to the leaderboard. Daniel is going to do a talk showing how it was put together, and then there'll be a 19th hole for everyone to work on (work in groups, singly, whatever works, there'll be experienced people to pair with if you've not used Ruby before).

Anyway, lots of fun, see you there.
